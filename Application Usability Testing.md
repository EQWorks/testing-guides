## Objectives
The purpose of this document is an overview of the Paymi Mobile Application testing process and procedures. 

## Setup: 
Schedule a video call with testers so that they can walk you through how they would normally execute the sign up, linking, and user phases. 
Ask the users to “think out loud” when using the product in order to record the most authentic first impressions of the user experience.
Record the user’s process of using the product and note down the video time of any issues that occur. 
For the Paymi sign-up usability testing, ensure future Paymi users can effectively:
Download the application on iOS or Android.
Sign up for a paymi account.
Link a credit or debit card.
Enter a promotional code when signing up and use the code after sign-up (refer to the testing template for this)

## Testing Procedure

The procedures written are based on functional testing of the Paymi sign-up
and bank card linking process. 

The template contains the following tabs:

 1. Testing summary: a summary tab that includes the testing goals, testing plan, testing users, and testing methodologies.

 2. Tasks: Lists the required steps the user is to take and monitor to document and record. 

 3. Script reference: this tab contains a rough script of what we say when meeting the end users/testers

 4. Mobile notes and web notes: these two separate tabs record how the testing users react to the sign-up process and how the users perform the tasks via mobile phones or laptop.

 5. Mobile results and web results: these two separate tabs record the
success rate of the testing users performing each task.

 6. Mobile questionnaire and web questionnaire: the separate tabs
contain a post-meeting survey on how the users felt about the sign-up
process. To be filled out with the tester at the end. 

## Documenting End User Testing:
 1. Go to the tab that the task requires. 

 2. Refer to each task in the tasks tab as the user navigates the app.
 
 3. Document outcomes and time stamps from the video.  

 4. Organize all issues observed into a summary document and categorize them into
different issue types, be sure to attach screenshots for reference.
